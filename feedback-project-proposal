Overall your project idea is good. I just feel most of the prototype and visualizations that you have created has too much going on. 
Very crowded visualization can sometimes not be considered good. I would like to hear from you all how you are going to explain 
everything just by showing visualization (maybe you can make your visualization less cluttered, or have a really good interaction
to make it pretty with proper labels).
We can discuss this by setting up a meeting. Thanks :)
